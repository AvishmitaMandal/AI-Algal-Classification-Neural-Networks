## Abstract 

The identification and monitoring of algal populations
are crucial for assessing water quality, understanding
ecosystem dynamics, and mitigating risks associated with
**harmful algal blooms (HABs)**. This project proposes the
use of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) image
recognition algorithms to revolutionize the process of
identifying algae and monitoring water quality.
We propose a novel approach to address the challenges
of training deeper neural networks in the context of algae
identification and monitoring. 

Drawing inspiration from
the residual learning framework and Transformers, we
aim to ease the training process of networks substantially
deeper than those used previously. Through
comprehensive empirical evaluations of datasets obtained
from FlowCam imagery and human classifications, our
goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in developing a robust neural network model capable of
accurately identifying and categorizing phytoplankton
species present in water samples. To achieve this, we
employed a range of models including **ViT, CNN,
AlexNet, ResNet**, and **FNN**, with **ViT** emerging as the
most successful model, achieving remarkable test
accuracies of **98.45%** and **97.27%** for the **5-Classes** and
**10-Classes classification** tasks, respectively.

## Dataset

Our dataset comes from an extensive database dump
produced by **FlowCam**, a tool designed to take
high-resolution images of microscopic algae. These
photos have been meticulously categorized into discrete
groupings, creating an extensive database of years of
data-gathering efforts by the **City of Bloomington**
researchers.
